# world-happiness

This project looks at happiness scores across the world in 2015, 2015, and 2019 and answers the questions:

Which country / region was the happiest in the world in 2019?
How did happinesss scores change across the world from 2015-2016?

I used exploratory analysis and merged two csv files to plot a graph showing change over time.
